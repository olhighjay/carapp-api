Roles say what an employee can do and cannot do. For example an employee may be an admin or driver or just staff

CATEGORIES 
Employees and cars and drivers are put together ioj categories. Categories are there for users to be a grroup and they can do what that category can do.
For example, while employees in the category of staff may have to wait for the system to choose car and driver for them, employees in the executive category
may be able to choose driver and cars for themselves and still be able to allow system choose for them if they want. They can pick from the trip request form
if they want to select car and or driver themselves or they want to systemt to do that for them. Also, drivers or cars in a particular category can only be 
by users in that category except the cars and drivers in the all category that c an be used by all.
If you don't want segregation among the users and tou wamnt them all to have access to all the cars and drivers, then y0ou can put all the users in all category
